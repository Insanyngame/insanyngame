I'm a extremely new programmer to the society, began to learn c++ on March, 2020.
Currently, I'm learning JavaScipt by using the (Eloquent Javascript)[https://https://eloquentjavascript.net] guide, that a friend introduced me.

I have a dream to become a really professional programmer, and every day that passes, I feel my dram being accomplished a little bit.

Thanks for reading! Hope you a good day!
