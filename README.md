I'm an average programmer that began to learn c++ on March, 2020.
Currently I program Discord Bots(with JS), websites and games(with HTML, CSS and JS).

I have a dream to become a really professional programmer, and every day that passes, I feel my dram being accomplished a little bit.

Thanks for reading! Hope you a good day!
